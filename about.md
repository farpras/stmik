Hello, my name is Farpras. Not a real name, cause why should I? :D
This is a blog based on Jekyll and is open sourced. You can find the source <a href="https://github.com/farpras/blog">here</a>. I will post anything about my stuffs here. Such as music, projects, tips, tutorial, and others.

My hobby is making music, and it's become my passion since I graduated from high school. Mostly, I'm making instrumental cover and remix of Anime soundtracks on my <a href="http://www.youtube.com/farpras">YouTube channel</a>. Beside of music producing, I also really like programming. Currently I'm learning some programming language such as JavaScript, PHP, Python, C#, and Java. Ah, right... HTML too.
